- __Quiz Page__

  - This page has the quiz and some features that will provide the user with some questions and alternatives. After starting the quiz via the "start" button, another button appears which is called "restart". The function of this button is to give the user the option of restarting the game if they either put the wrong answer or if they just want a fresh start.
  - It also includes a true/false function that pops up everytime the user answers the questions.
  - And lastly the "next" button, which as it's name implies, goes straight to the next question

### Features left to implement

Due to lack of time, a small detail which would make the quiz a bit more interactive was not a priority.

- Add more hover effects to the alternative buttons to make the page a bit more interesting for the user.
